Taipan Train is a game that is a remixed version of the iconic Snake Game.
The player controls the train, which replaces the snake, on train tracks, and the passengers are waiting on the train tracks in their own carts to be collected.
The game's objective is to collect as many passengers as possible and add them to your train.
Your score is displayed on the game over screen after you lose.

When you boot up Taipan Train, you can choose from three boxes: PLAY, OPTIONS, and QUIT. PLAY moves you onto the Difficulty Select screen; OPTIONS takes you to the options 
to change the game's volume, QUIT closes the Taipan Train application.

Taipan Train has three difficulties to choose from once you click PLAY:

Taipan(Medium):
Taipan is based on a snake called Taipan, a very venomous snake located in Australia. 
It is also our inspiration for the name of the game. The train model in the game is based on the Pacific Diesel Locomotive.

Titanoboa(Easy):
Titanoboa is based on the prehistoric snake called Titanoboa and is said to have been the biggest snake in existence but not very fast compared to its
overall body size. The train model in the game is based on a Steam Engine Train.

BlackMamba(Hard):
BlackMamba is based on the Black Mamba Snake, a very venomous and fast snake found in sub-Saharan Africa. The train model in-game is based 
on a bullet train, known to be the fastest train type in the world. It can travel across vast lands in the span of a few hours.
